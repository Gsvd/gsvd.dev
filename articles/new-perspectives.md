## Context

When I pause to think about it, I realize I've seldom had the luxury to truly reflect on who I am, my aspirations, and the direction I want to head in.

The academic journey ends, and we're quickly thrust into the whirlwind of higher education. Everything seems to move at breakneck speed: freshman year â†’ internship â†’ sophomore year â†’ internship â†’ junior year â†’ work-study â†’ senior year â†’ work-study â†’ thesis writing â†’ post-grad year â†’ work-study â†’ thesis â†’ securing that first job.

Now, after three years in the professional world, I feel time slipping away even faster than before. That's why I recently took some time to genuinely ponder what I truly want for my future.

Over the past few years, I've caught myself settling into an all-too-familiar life pattern, despite being fully aware of its repetitiveness. Routines have formed, some out of habit, others out of convenience. I'm not saying a comfortable life is a problem, but it's essential to explore other parts of this vast world â€” to encounter different mindsets and cultures. To not be boxed into what we're used to and to continually seek renewal.

That's why, in the middle of this year, I decided to take the leap and change everything. I plan to leave my hometown and embark on a new journey to a different continent in 2024, specifically to Quebec.

Driven by my passion for development from a young age, I'm eager to bring my knowledge to this new chapter in my life.

## Resolutions

With the wind of change motivation at my back, I've revamped my website and resume.

As the saying goes "The cobbler's children have no shoes".

This applies even more so to developers and their personal websites. So, naturally, I didn't spend a ton of time on it, but it's still an improvement from what I had before.

For the curious ones, here are the technological choices I made:

* [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/)
* [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/)
* [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Probably an "overkill" choice, but after all, you're in my house now ðŸ˜‰

EDIT (2023-11-02): Upon reflection and further exploration, which I detail in my last article, I've reconsidered some of the technological choices listed above.
